// bogo Sort Algorithm
// The Bogo Sort algorithm, also known as "stupid sort," "slow sort," or "random sort," is an immensely inefficient sorting algorithm that is based on the generate-and-test paradigm. The algorithm works by randomly shuffling the input sequence (an array or a list) and checking if the shuffled sequence is sorted. This process is repeated until a sorted sequence is obtained. It is mainly used as an educational tool or a satirical reference for inefficient algorithms and is not suitable for practical applications due to its incredibly poor performance.

// The algorithm's name, "Bogo Sort," is derived from the word "bogosort," a blend of "bogus" and "sort," reflecting its impracticality. The average-case and worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is unbounded, as there is no guarantee it will ever finish due to the random nature of the shuffling. The best-case time complexity, however, is O(n), which occurs when the input sequence is already sorted. Because of its high time complexity, Bogo Sort is rarely used in real-world scenarios, and its primary purpose is to serve as a humorous example of an inefficient sorting technique.
